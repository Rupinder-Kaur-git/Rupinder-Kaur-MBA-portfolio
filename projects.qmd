**Role.** Opening shift lead coordinating prep, food safety checks, and first‑hour throughput.  
**Actions.**
- Checklist-driven open (equipment warm-up, line setup, temp checks)
- Delegated prep by station; verified labeling & FIFO rotation
- Managed front counter & POS, resolved order issues, supported new staff

**Outcome.** Reliable open, fewer reworks, smoother guest flow at peak.
